        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Simple recipe for slow cooked tofu prepared in the style of butter chicken.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 1/2 tablespoons garam masala</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground ginger </li>
            <li>1 teaspoon chilli powder</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>2 teaspoon curry powder</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons sea salt </li>
            <li>time 2 14 oz each cans of coconut milk (28 ounces total)</li>
            <li>12 ounces tomato paste</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon dried fenugreek, optional</li>
            <li>2 1lb blocks firm tofu, pressed for 30 minutes* (2 lbs in total)</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons coconut sugar, or brown sugar optional</li>
            <li>juice of two limes</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>After the tofu is finished pressing, cut the pressed tofu into cubes, or tear into cube size pieces for extra texture.</li>
            <li>Add all of the ingredients into the slow cooker except the tofu, coconut sugar and the lime.</li>
            <li>Whisk and mix together the ingredients and incorporate until the tomato paste is almost or completely mixed into the sauce.</li>
            <li>Add in the tofu, and stir gently, incorporating completely.</li>
            <li>Set the slow cooker to high for 3 to 4 hours or on low for 6-7 hours (for high, monitor the last 30 minutes and for low, monitor the last hour). At the end, stir in the lime juice and the coconut sugar. While the coconut sugar is optional, I found that it helped to really bring out some hidden flavours!</li>
            <li>Serve alongside naan bread and basmati rice and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
